# 🦾 Prosthetic Hand Control

## 🔍 Problem
Can a prosthetic hand be controlled without relying on external physical objects? 

## 💡 Solution
This challenge can be addressed using Electromyography (EMG) muscle sensors. These sensors detect the electrical activity produced by muscles, allowing the prosthetic hand to be controlled directly by the user's muscle movements, providing a more intuitive and seamless control mechanism.

## 🚀 Features
- **Direct Muscle Control**: Uses EMG sensors to capture muscle activity for controlling the prosthetic hand.
- **Seamless Integration**: No need for external devices or physical objects.
- **High Responsiveness**: Immediate response to muscle signals, enabling precise control of the prosthetic hand.
- **Customizable**: Adaptable to different muscle signals and user preferences.
